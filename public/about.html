<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated from San Francisco State University in 2016 with a bachelors in Psychology and a minor in Sexuality Studies</p>

<p>My background consists of being an ABO certified Optician at the Facebook campus. I then ventured into recruiting starting as a
  recruiting coordinator at Udemy, then was promoted to Sr. Recruiting Coordinator. During this time I was also building the Udemy University
  Recruiting Program from scratch with a fellow colleague and was a Technical Sourcer. I then continued as a Technical Sourcer for X, the Moonshot
  Factory (previously google x), Sentry.io, Envoy, and Discord. 
</p>

<p>In the last few months I've built a small business selling luxury bags sourced from Japan. I am also in the progress of building two tools
  that I wanted to create to help my small business. I realized many others can benefit what I'm creating and have decided to offer them as a SaaS.
  Follow me on my journey!
